# 🎧 Spotify Song Analysis & Clustering
A data-driven exploration of popular songs using the Spotify API.

This project was developed by **Yash Soni** as part of my continuous learning in data science and machine learning. The dataset was generated using Python’s `spotipy` library with queries based on characters (A-Z, 0-9), resulting in a collection of 1750 songs.

## 🔍 Objective
To analyze song features and apply **K-Means Clustering** to group songs with similar characteristics (energy, danceability, tempo, etc.).

## 📦 Dataset
- Collected from the Spotify API  
- 1750 songs with detailed numerical attributes  
- Provided in `spotify_data.csv`

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Spotipy (Spotify API)  
- Machine Learning: **K-Means Clustering**

## 📌 Outcome
Clustered songs based on their musical features, identifying patterns and similarities in what makes a song energetic, mellow, or danceable.
